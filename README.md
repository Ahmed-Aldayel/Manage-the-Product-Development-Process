##### As part of the project, I will live through various scenarios that a PM typically faces or is expected to carry out during the development phase:

###### 1- Create a project blueprint that can be used by me or the involved stakeholders to understand their role, task and targeted milestone.
###### 2- Plan for a sprint meeting to ensure that the team can understand and focus on the deliverable.
###### 3- Respond to different scenarios that may require me to reprioritize the sprint backlog or manage expectations with stakeholders accordingly.
###### 4- Apply my learnings from the course to understand the API documentation and use this information to engage with the scrum team accordingly.
